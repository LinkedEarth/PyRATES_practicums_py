# PyRATES: Python and R Analysis of Time Series

This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) showcases Python-based practicums for the PyRATES training activity, parts of the Facilitating Reproducible, Open Geoscience (FROGS) [grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2324732&HistoricalAwards=false) awarded to the [LinkedEarth core team](http://linked.earth/#core-team) and NAU's David Edge by the US National Science Foundation (award 2324732).

These practicums are meant to complement the lecture materials (URL placeholder) and self-paced learning platform (URL placeholder) generated as part of PyRATES. They make abundant use of the [Pyleoclim package](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022PA004509), yet draw inspiration from various fields of the geosciences, including seismology, geochemistry, climate dynamics, hydrology and paleoclimatology.
